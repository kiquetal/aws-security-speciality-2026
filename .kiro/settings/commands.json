First, cross-reference this content with 'blueprint.md' to ensure I haven't missed any key 'Task Statements' related to this service.\n2. If the note is complete, generate a **Scenario-Based Question** (similar to the SCS-C03 exam format) that tests a specific detail from this note.\n3. Do NOT reveal the answer yet. Wait for me to provide my solution.\n4. Once I answer, evaluate if I am 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' and explain the 'Why' using official AWS documentation logic."

Ignore generic terms like 'cloud' or 'server'.\n\n2. **Execution Plan:** For EACH identified service:\n   a. Check if a file named `faq-[service-name].md` already exists. If yes, skip it.\n   b. If no, use the **Browser Tool** to search for 'AWS [Service Name] official FAQs'.\n   c. **Fetch** the content from the official aws.amazon.com page.\n   d. **Create** a new file named `faq-[service-name].md` in the `/notes` folder.\n\n3. **Content Structure:** Inside the new FAQ file, summarize the content into these three headers:\n   - **## Security Use Cases** (Critical for the SCS-C03 exam)\n   - **## Key Limits/Quotas**\n   - **## Exam Gotchas** (Confusing points)\n\nConstraint: Do not dump the whole text. Synthesize it for a Staff Engineer preparing for the Security Specialty."
