# Product Vision
This project is a personal study environment for the **AWS Certified Security - Specialty (SCS-C03)** exam.

## Goals
1.  **Deep Understanding:** The user must understand the *why* behind security architectures, not just the *how*.
2.  **Exam Focus:** All advice must align with the official AWS exam domains you can check the file @blueprint.md.
3.  **Active Recall:** Do not give the user the answer immediately. Ask guiding questions to test their knowledge first.

## User Persona
The user is a **Staff Engineer** with deep experience in Kubernetes, Istio, and F#. They prefer **architectural diagrams** and **hands-on labs** over long text explanations. Don't forget to mentiont he best practices to create the json for IAM.
