| # | Domain | Question / Scenario | Your Answer | Result | Correct Answer | Review Topic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | D1 | S3 bucket exfiltrated object-by-object — which CloudTrail event type? Enabled by default? | "Not enabled by default, PutEvent" | ⚠️ | Data events, **GetObject** (not Put). Not enabled by default. | CloudTrail data vs management events |
| 2 | D1 | Lambda `UpdProdCount` — most flexible way to log invocations? | Didn't know | ❌ | Advanced event selectors with `StartsWith` on resource ARN | Basic vs Advanced event selectors |
| 3 | D3 | Session Manager — security advantage from network perspective? | "No open ports" | ✅ | No inbound ports needed — outbound HTTPS only | Session Manager |
| 4 | D3 | NACLs or Security Groups — which is stateless and needs ephemeral ports? | "NACLs, 100% sure" | ✅ | NACLs are stateless | NACLs vs Security Groups |
| 5 | D1 | Detect public S3 buckets org-wide with least overhead? | Didn't know | ❌ | **Security Hub** — built-in S3 controls, org-wide | Security services comparison |
| 6 | D1 | Lambda stopped logging — Config + what? | Confused | ⚠️ | Depends: role changed → Config + IAM Access Analyzer. Role fine → CloudWatch Logs Insights | Troubleshooting (Task 1.3) |
| 7 | D4 | Resource-based policy vs RCP — difference? | Confused them | ⚠️ | RBP = per-resource, grants access. RCP = org-wide ceiling, never grants. | Policy layers reference |
| 8 | D5 | Can you rotate imported KMS key material? | "Yes" | ✅ | Yes, but only manually (alias swap) | KMS rotation matrix |
| 9 | D5 | KMS imported key — who owns durability? | "You" | ✅ | You — AWS doesn't back up imported material | KMS imported keys |
| 10 | D5 | Import NEW material into EXISTING key? | Knew it was wrong | ✅ | ❌ Can't — only re-import SAME material. New material = new key + alias swap. | KMS imported keys |
| 11 | D4 | Why can't you use RAM for KMS cross-account? | "RAM is not for sharing?" | ⚠️ | RAM IS for sharing, but doesn't support KMS. Use KMS Grants. | RAM vs KMS Grants |
| 12 | D4 | RAM vs RCP — difference? | "Didn't remember RCP" | ⚠️ | RAM shares infrastructure. RCP restricts data access. Opposite problems. | faq-ram-vs-rcp.md |
| 13 | D1 | Suspicious root login attempts — GuardDuty vs CloudTrail + CloudWatch? | Chose CloudTrail + CloudWatch | ❌ | **GuardDuty + EventBridge** — "suspicious" = GuardDuty, least overhead | GuardDuty vs CloudTrail |
| 14 | D3 | Lambda in private subnet — restrict domain lookup to one domain? | Didn't know | ❌ | **Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall** | DNS Firewall |
| 15 | D5 | Cross-account S3 + SSE-KMS — how many policies needed? | Got Account A right, missed B | ⚠️ | THREE: bucket policy + key policy + identity policy on caller | Cross-account patterns |
| 16 | D4 | When to use RCP — identify the use case? | Got it after review | ✅ | "Outsiders + my data + org-wide" → RCP | RCP use cases |
| 17 | D1 | GuardDuty — what is it responsible for? | "GuardDuty" (for crypto mining) | ✅ | Threat detection — active malicious behavior | Security services |
| 18 | D1 | Security Hub setup order — 4 steps? | Followed along | ✅ | Enable SH → make admin → enable members → assume roles | Security Hub |
| 19 | D4 | `aws:PrincipalIsAWSService` — when to use? | Understood after explanation | ✅ | Always add when using PrincipalOrgID deny — exempts CloudTrail, Config, etc. | RCP conditions |
| 20 | D4 | VPC endpoints — why 3 for Session Manager? | Understood | ✅ | `ssm` (API) + `ssmmessages` (session) + `ec2messages` (heartbeat) | Session Manager VPC endpoints |

| 35 | D3 | Decrypt TLS traffic, inspect plaintext for malware, re-encrypt? | WAF Advanced | ❌ | **Network Firewall** — TLS inspection is Network Firewall only, WAF never decrypts | — | Network Firewall TLS inspection |


### Session 5 — 2025-05-05

**Domains:** D4 Identity & Access Management (re-test)

| # | Domain | Question / Scenario | Your Answer | Result | Correct Answer | Re-test of | Review Topic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 36 | D4 | Dev puts Principal:* on bucket policy, external attacker reads objects. Block all external S3 access org-wide without modifying bucket policies — which policy type and why not SCP? | "SCP can't stop external accounts, RCP is the answer" + knew PrincipalIsAWSService condition | ✅ | RCP — evaluated on resource side regardless of caller. SCP only governs principals inside your org. Conditions: PrincipalOrgID + PrincipalIsAWSService:false with IfExists. | Q7 | Policy layers — RCP vs SCP |
| 37 | D4 | 300 customers need Decrypt on your KMS key, onboard/offboard weekly. Junior suggests RAM — why won't it work? | "Limitations maybe? KMS Grants is the answer" — didn't know RAM's service list excludes KMS | ⚠️ | RAM doesn't support KMS (infrastructure only: TGW, subnets, Route 53). Even if it did, RAM shares entire resource — Grants give per-operation control (Decrypt only). Key policy 32KB limit ~200 principals; Grants unlimited. | Q11 | RAM vs KMS Grants |
| 38 | D4 | One sentence each: what problem does RAM solve vs RCP? | "RAM shares resources between accounts. RCP manage control?" — RCP answer too vague | ⚠️ | RAM = OPENS access (share infrastructure cross-account). RCP = CLOSES access (deny external principals from data org-wide). Opposite problems, different service lists, zero overlap. | Q12 | RAM vs RCP |

### Session 6 — 2025-05-05

**Domains:** D4 Identity & Access Management (policy layers quiz)
**Score:** 3 ✅ · 0 ⚠️ · 2 ❌ (60% correct)

| # | Domain | Question / Scenario | Your Answer | Result | Correct Answer | Re-test of | Review Topic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 39 | D4 | SLR in Account A does PutObject, RCP denies non-org principals — does SLR succeed? | "Fails — RCP needs PrincipalIsAWSService rule" | ❌ | **Succeeds** — SLRs are completely exempt from RCPs (separate mechanism from PrincipalIsAWSService). | — | RCP exemptions (SLR vs service principal) |
| 40 | D4 | Role identity policy allows kms:Decrypt, boundary only allows s3:* and ec2:* — what happens? | "Denied — boundary doesn't include KMS" | ✅ | Denied. Permission boundary is a ceiling; kms:Decrypt outside boundary = blocked at Gate 3. | — | Permission boundary as ceiling |
| 41 | D4 | External Account B assumes role in Account A, role allows s3:GetObject, SCP allows all, no RCP — succeeds? | "Succeeds — evaluated against Account A's role policies" | ✅ | Succeeds. Once role is assumed, evaluation uses Account A's SCP + role's identity policy + boundary. | — | Cross-account evaluation |
| 42 | D4 | RCP denies kms:Decrypt for external principals. CloudTrail needs to decrypt — blocked? | "RCP doesn't support KMS?" | ❌ | **Succeeds** — RCP condition `PrincipalIsAWSService: false` doesn't match CloudTrail (it IS a service), so Deny doesn't fire. RCP does support KMS. | — | RCP exemptions (PrincipalIsAWSService) |
| 43 | D4 | Role: identity=Allow s3:*, boundary=Allow GetObject+ListBucket only. Calls PutObject? | "Denied — boundary limits" | ✅ | Denied. Boundary ceiling doesn't include PutObject. Gate 3 blocks. | — | Permission boundary as ceiling |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 44 | D4 | RCP denies s3:* for non-org. ELB SLR writes access logs to S3 — blocked? | "RCP can't block service-linked role" | ✅ | Allowed — SLRs are structurally exempt from RCPs | Q39 | RCP exemptions (SLR) |
| 45 | D4 | Identity allows s3:*, boundary allows s3:Get* only. Calls s3:DeleteObject? | "Permission boundary blocks it" | ✅ | Denied — Gate 3 (boundary) doesn't include DeleteObject | — | Permission boundary |
| 46 | D4 | 400 external accounts need Decrypt, key policy at 30KB — mechanism? | "KMS Grants" | ✅ | KMS Grants — key policy near 32KB limit, grants scale without policy edits | Q37 | KMS Grants |
| 47 | D4 | Role chaining A→B→C, Role C MaxSessionDuration=12hr — actual max? | "1 hour" | ✅ | 1 hour — role chaining always resets to 1hr max | — | Role chaining |
| 48 | D4 | External account calls s3:GetObject, bucket policy grants access, no RCP — need identity policy? | "No" | ✅ | No — resource-based policy alone grants cross-account (except KMS) | — | Cross-account evaluation |

| 51 | D4 | Federated Okta user needs project-scoped S3 access without per-user policies? | "ABAC with ResourceTag = PrincipalTag" | ✅ | Session tags from IdP + ABAC: aws:ResourceTag/Project = ${aws:PrincipalTag/Project} | — | ABAC + session tags |
| 52 | D4 | Role chaining A→B→C, Role C MaxSessionDuration=12hr — actual max? | "1 hour" | ✅ | 1 hour — role chaining always resets | — | Role chaining |
| 53 | D4 | Cross-account KMS decrypt — minimum policies needed? | "Key policy + identity policy in Account B" | ⚠️ | Both sides must agree: key policy names Account B + Account B identity policy allows kms:Decrypt on key ARN. Got the concept, imprecise wording. | — | Cross-account KMS |
| 54 | D4 | Can GetCallerIdentity be denied by SCP? | "No" | ✅ | Cannot be denied by any policy — always works | — | STS |
| 55 | D4 | RCP denies kms:Decrypt with PrincipalIsAWSService:false. AWS Config decrypts? | "Allowed" | ✅ | Allowed — Config is AWS service principal, condition doesn't match, deny doesn't fire | Q42 | RCP exemptions |
| 56 | D4 | Identity allows ec2:*, boundary allows RunInstances+Describe only. TerminateInstances? | "Denied" | ✅ | Denied — Gate 3 boundary doesn't include TerminateInstances | — | Permission boundary |
| 57 | D4 | Share Transit Gateway with 30 dev accounts in org? | "RAM" | ✅ | RAM — infrastructure sharing within org, auto-accept | — | RAM |
| 58 | D4 | SCP denies s3:DeleteBucket. Role identity allows s3:*. DeleteBucket? | "Denied, Gate 1" | ✅ | Denied — SCP explicit deny always wins over identity policy Allow | — | SCP |
